# STANDARD

*A minimal wallpaper library*

STANDARD is a **frontend-only wallpaper website** focused on quiet presentation and direct downloads.
The project removes all non-essential UI elements to let visuals lead the experience.

There are no accounts, no social features, no interactions beyond viewing and downloading.

---

## About

STANDARD is built around one idea:

> If it doesn’t help someone download a wallpaper, it doesn’t belong.

Wallpapers are manually curated and added through code. The interface is intentionally reduced to maintain clarity, focus, and visual calm.
